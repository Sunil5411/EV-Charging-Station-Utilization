## 📈 Top 5 Unique KPIs

| KPI # | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔋 1. **Average Utilization Rate (%)** – % of time stations were actively charging. |
| 🕒 2. **Peak-Hour Load Index** – Station load during peak hours vs. off-peak. |
| 📍 3. **Station Downtime Frequency** – Count of inactive hours across stations. |
| 📊 4. **Regional Demand Clustering** – Number of clusters by geographic demand. |
| ⚠️ 5. **Underperforming Station Score** – Weighted score for low-usage stations based on location, availability, and usage patterns. |
